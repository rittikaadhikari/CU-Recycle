# CU-Recycle
A community-focused natural resource recycling initiative designed to promote civic application of proper recycling practices. Ultimately our objective is to discourage and prevent poor recycling behavior that depresses operational capabilities of relevant facilities and remove uncertainty regarding standard behavior.

# OBJECTIVE
Only roughly 35% of recyclable materials are accurately identified and sent to the correct facilities in the USA. In Chicago that number drops to 9. According to the EPA, uncertainty regarding what is usable was a major factor in depressing recycling rates. Furthermore, incorrect materials being recycled led to nearly half of recycled goods being ultimately wasted. The objective of our android application is to automatically identify whether a certain object is recyclable in accordance to the local municipial regulations to resolve these issues within the system. Our ambition is to remove the formerly mentioned roadblocks to promote environmentally friendly and industry supportive habits.

# GAME PLAN
Currently we are in the works of developing an android application and the relevant systems with a focus and prioritization on the Champaign-Urbana area. [Insert Techy Shit]

# CONCLUSION
We sincerely hope that our efforts to promote and enable every CU citizen's responsibility to protect the environment results in aggregate benefits. Every member of our community has incredible potential to effect positive change as an individual within the collective of their localities. So as we all go through our typical routines, keep in mind that your community would love to C U Recycle. (THAT IS SO FUCKING CRINGY)
